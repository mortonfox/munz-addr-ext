# Munz Addr Chrome Extension

## Introduction

[Munzee](https://www.munzee.com) info pages used to display the approximate
address of the Munzee's coordinates below the mini map. This feature seems to
have been dropped after the switchover from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap.

Munz Addr is a Chrome extension that uses the [Bing Maps
API](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) to reverse-geocode a Munzee's
coordinates and adds the resulting street address below the mini map, where it
used to be.
